homebrew-core

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/halyard/homebrew-core/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/halyard/homebrew-core)

This is my personal fork of a full system's worth of Mac [homebrew](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core) formulas.

Not designed to work w/ a stock Homebrew; I use this by deleting the `homebrew/homebrew-core` default tap and replacing it with this.
